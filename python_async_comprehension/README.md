In here we'll cover projects related to async comprehension:
task 1)
	Coroutine that loops 10 times async, waits 1 sec then yields a random
task 2)
	Coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using comp over async_generator, then return the 10 nums
task 3)
	Coroutine that'll execute async_comp 4 times in parallel using gather()
