This is a README containing the following projects:
0.Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b \
as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
1.Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a \
string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string
2.Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument \
and returns the floor of the float.
3.Write a type-annotated function to str that takes a float n as argument \
and returns the string representation of the float.
4.Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values: \
a (int), pi (float), school (string)
5.Write a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of \
floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.
6.Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst \
of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
7.Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR \
float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the \
string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.
